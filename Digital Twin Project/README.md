# dt-water-project
Digital twin of water distribution system using Python and WNTR


A real-time hydraulic simulation dashboard for a water distribution network, made in Python utilising the WNTR (Water Network Tool for Resilience) package. This project demonstrates digital twin concepts that apply to real-world systems and are particularly useful for predictive maintenance and real-time monitoring across energy, aerospace, nuclear and utilities sectors.
